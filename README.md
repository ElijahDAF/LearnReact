# React Workshop: Building a Shopping List Application

Welcome to the React Workshop! In this workshop, we will build a simple shopping list ðŸ›’ application using React. This README will guide you through the setup and provide an overview of the project structure.

## Project Structure

- **App.jsx**: This file contains the main component of our application. It manages the state of the tasks and handles adding and deleting tasks.
- **App.css**: This file contains the styles for our application, including layout, colors, and button styles.
- **package.json**: This file contains the project dependencies and scripts for running and building the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone your fork:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GDSCGuelph/LearnReact
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd shopping-list
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Application Overview

### App.jsx

The `App.jsx` file contains the main component of our application. It includes the following features:

- **State Management**: Uses the `useState` hook to manage the list of tasks and the input value.
- **Add Task**: Adds a new task to the list when the "Add" button is clicked.
- **Delete Task**: Removes a task from the list when the "Purchase" button is clicked.

### App.css

The `App.css` file contains the styles for our application. It includes:

- **Variables**: Defines CSS variables for colors and shadows.
- **Layout**: Styles for the container, input, and task items.
- **Button Styles**: Styles for the add and delete buttons.

### package.json

The `package.json` file includes the project dependencies and scripts. Key dependencies include:

- **React**: The main library for building the user interface.
- **React DOM**: Provides DOM-specific methods for React.
- **React Scripts**: Scripts and configuration used by Create React App.

## Conclusion

By the end of this workshop, you will have a functional shopping list application built with React. Feel free to customize and expand the application further. Happy coding!
